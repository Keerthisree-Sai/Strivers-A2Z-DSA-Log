# Strivers A2Z DSA Log

Welcome to my personal journey through the [Strivers A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/) 🚀

This repository is a record of my daily DSA practice — not just code, but also the thinking process, patterns, and mindset I'm building to become a better problem solver.

## Goal

- Strengthen DSA skills through consistent daily practice  
- Understand problem-solving approaches from brute-force to optimal  
- Learn **how to think**, not just how to code  
- Build a strong GitHub portfolio with structured and meaningful contributions  

## What Makes This Different?

This isn't just about solving problems — it's about solving them smartly:

- **Mindset Notes**: How I’m learning to think about optimizing solutions  
- **Patterns Recognition**: Hashing, two pointers, sliding window, etc.  
- **Reflections**: Key takeaways or “aha!” moments from each problem

## Daily Strategy

- Solve 3 problems per day:
  - 1 Easy  
  - 1 Medium  
  - 1 Hard
- Write mindset notes and explain:
  - What I understood
  - How I approached it
  - How optimal solutions reduce time/space complexity
